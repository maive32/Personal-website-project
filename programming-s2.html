    <p>Our next project was a tourism website, a site to provide information about different places to visit. The major difference between this project and my first website was that we worked in teams.</p>
    <p>The project required the website to meet certain standards, similar to the last one. The following were the necessary content pages: Home, Destinations, About, Discover, and Visit. Each page needs a Hero image, with consistent color and font usage, and the text should be free of punctuation, grammar, and spelling errors. Pictures needed to be credited to the author, and references used for research. Lastly, the code had to pass a W3C HTML validator. </p>
    <p>The process for making this project had some extra steps. We did research beforehand about the different countries we choose, Russia, Canada, and Germany. Each member makes their own moodboard. We then choose together who’s moodboard we like the most, and improve upon their original design. We ended up with a moodboard with a warm red, light blue, and orange. We moved onto creating the prototype in figma, and then to coding.</p>
    <p>The skills I’ve learned from this project are research and collaboration. I’ve learned how to brainstorm ideas for our website, share code, and help each other. I also had to do research involving the culture, history, and transportation of Germany. Generally this project was better than my last, partially because the work was divided evenly.</p>
