        <p>Hello! My name is Kiera, and I'm a soon-to-be graduate from Fresno City College. I also attended the Center for Advanced Research and Technology (CART) for 2 years. The first year, I was in the Cybersecurity lab during lock down and this year as a Web development student. After graduating from high school, I'll be majoring in English at Fresno City College. During the summer, I'm planning to learn new hobbies like drawing and reading, and volunteering.</p>

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>Occasionally when I'm in the modd, I like to draw. Someday I would like to take it seriously, but for now I just draw doodles every now and then. The quality of my drawings vary greatly, sometimes I'm happy with how they turned out. I don't usually finish, however I am pround of my OneShot drawing. Anyway here's a couple of sketches.</p>
