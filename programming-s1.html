    <h2>First Website</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="sample-wrap">
    <p>Chronoshift was my very first website coded by me, utilizing only HTML and CSS. It was a tourism website, so every requirement revolved 
        around what the audience of a typical tourism user expected. For example, a way to book a trip or an "about" page for the service the website provides</p>
    <p>The website was expected to have the required content pages such as "Home","About","Expeditions","Rules", and "Book now." The content within those pages were 
        to be free of punctuation, grammar, and spelling errors with each having "Hero" image on each. It was to look clean, and consistent with easy to read text. 
        The code had to pass a W3C HTML validator. The process for making the website was simple. I started by making a prototype with Figma. I worked on that for 
        several days before moving to coding. The website is fairly static, there was no need for a code flowchart.</p>
    <p>I had trouble with understanding HTML at first, formatting was difficult before I got used it. There were mistakes. I made the process harder, first how I 
        saved my code. Sometimes I forgot to upload the current version to google drive and then I couldn't work on it. The second was priorities, I should simplify the website. 
        This would have given more time to validate the code, something I didn't end up doing.</p>
