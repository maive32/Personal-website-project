        <h2>Writing</h2>
        <p>I believe this is my first argumentative essay I’ve written, and it has strict requirements. I had orginally picked an anti-gun control position, listing how many guns were used for defence but my arguments were refuted. I had changed then my position into pro-gun control. The research I had done took some time but it was worth doing. A major problem I have with this essay is that it sounds like it’s reading off statistics. I’d put more emotion into next time, and relate it to something relative at the time.</p>

        <p>This is the sort of essay I like writing, and I think it’s still decent. The introduction and conclusion are a well enough written summary of my thoughts. The problems I have would be the body paragraphs. They feel like plot synopsis rather than actual analysis.</p>
